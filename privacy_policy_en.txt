Part 1: Safety Instructions for Model/Technology

1. android-use Technology Mechanism and Deployment Flexibility
The core function of android-use is automated operation execution. Its working principle is as follows:
- Instruction Driven: Based on operation instructions issued by users or developers.
- Screen Understanding: Captures the screen content of the current operating environment and sends the image to a large model (deployed locally or in the cloud) for analysis and understanding.
- Operation Simulation: Simulates human operation methods (such as clicking, sliding, entering information, etc.) to complete tasks in the target environment.
- Example: When the instruction requires ordering a high-speed rail ticket, android-use will open the relevant application, identify the interface content, select the train number according to the instruction, and complete the order, just like manual operation. Users or developers can terminate the task at any time.

Key Flexibility:
- Model Deployment: Developers can freely choose to deploy the android-use model on local devices or cloud servers.
- Operation Execution Environment: Automated operations can be executed on local devices or cloud devices, determined by developers based on application scenarios and needs.
- Data Flow: Data flow depends on the deployment choice:
  - Local Deployment (Model + Execution): Screen capture, model analysis, and operation execution are all completed on the local device. Data does not leave the device, offering the highest privacy.
  - Cloud Deployment (Model + Execution): Screen content needs to be transmitted from the operating environment (local or cloud device) to the cloud model. After model analysis, instructions are returned to the operating environment for execution. Developers need to ensure the security of transmission and cloud processing.
  - Hybrid Deployment (e.g., Local Execution + Cloud Model): Screen content is captured locally and transmitted to the cloud model for analysis. The analysis results are returned to the local device for execution. Developers need to pay attention to data transmission security.

2. System Permission Call Explanation (For Operation Execution Environment)
To ensure the normal execution of automated operations, the environment running android-use operations may need to obtain the following permissions:
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Permission: Used to obtain information and simulate user interactions such as clicking, sliding, and inputting.
- Storage Permission: Used to temporarily store necessary data, model files (if deployed locally), or logs.
- Network Permission: Used to access online services (such as calling cloud models, accessing target application services).
- Other Specific Permissions: May be required depending on the specific task (e.g., microphone for voice instructions).

Developer Responsibilities:
- Principle of Least Privilege: Request only the permissions absolutely necessary to complete the specific task.
- Transparent Notification: Clearly and explicitly explain the purpose and necessity of each permission to the end user in the application or service.
- User Authorization: Must obtain explicit authorization from the end user before enabling relevant permissions and functions in the operation environment.
- Environment Adaptation: Ensure that the permission request and acquisition mechanism is adapted to the chosen operation execution environment (local or cloud).

3. Data Processing and Privacy Protection Principles
The android-use open source project itself does not collect user data. The responsibility for data processing and privacy protection lies with the developer developing specific applications or services based on android-use. Their responsibility depends on the deployment method:
- Local Deployment (Model + Execution):
  - Developers need to implement secure storage and processing of local data at the application level. All data processing (screen capture, model analysis, operation execution) is completed on the end user's local device.
  - Developers should ensure that their applications do not actively upload sensitive data (such as screen content, operation records) to developer servers or third parties unless the user is explicitly informed and consents, and it is a necessary function.
- Cloud Deployment (Model or Execution or Both):
  - Involves the transmission of data (screen content, operation instructions, model analysis results) between the operation environment and the cloud.
  - Developers must:
    - Implement strong encryption to protect all transmitted and stored data.
    - Clearly inform end users which data will be sent to the cloud, the purpose of sending, storage location, and retention period, and obtain explicit consent from end users for data transmission and cloud processing.
    - Comply with applicable data protection regulations, provide a clear privacy policy, and explain data processing practices.
    - Ensure the secure configuration and access control of the cloud environment (model server, operation environment server).
- General Principles (All Deployment Methods):
  - Data Minimization: Collect and process only the minimum information absolutely necessary to complete the automated task.
  - Purpose Limitation: Data is used only to achieve the specific automated operation purpose of the user instruction.
  - Security Guarantee: Developers are responsible for taking reasonable technical and management measures to protect the security and confidentiality of all user data they process (whether local or cloud) to prevent unauthorized access, use, leakage, or loss.
  - User Control: Provide mechanisms for end users to view and manage (e.g., delete) data related to them (where technically feasible and consistent with the deployment method).

Part 2: Usage Specifications for Developers/Users

Developers/Users should always follow applicable laws, regulations, and standards in the place of use, such as the "Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China", "Provisions on the Administration of Algorithm Recommendation for Internet Information Services", "Provisions on the Administration of Deep Synthesis for Internet Information Services", "Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services", "Basic Security Requirements for Generative Artificial Intelligence Service", etc. when using the android-use open source project. Furthermore, based on the requirements of the "Measures for the Labeling of Artificial Intelligence Generated or Synthesized Content" and "Cybersecurity Technology - Methods for Labeling Artificial Intelligence Generated or Synthesized Content (GB45438-2025)" and application scenarios, artificial intelligence generated or synthesized content must be labeled, including but not limited to explicit labeling and implicit labeling (metadata labeling and digital watermarking).

1. Important Operation Confirmation Mechanism

Developers must design and implement clear, mandatory user confirmation steps for the following 6+1 high-risk operations in their applications or services developed based on android-use:
- Information Interaction and Content Dissemination: Including but not limited to sending messages, emails, posting comments, liking, sharing, etc.
- File Disposal and Permission Management: Including but not limited to creating, editing, deleting, moving files or folders, turning permissions on or off, etc.
- Transaction Orders and Rights Disposal: Including but not limited to emptying shopping carts, submitting orders, modifying/adding shipping addresses, using coupons/points, etc.
- Funds Transfer and Payment Settlement: Including but not limited to transferring funds, paying, collecting payments, recharging, withdrawing cash, binding/unbinding payment methods, etc.
- Account Identity and Security Configuration: Including but not limited to changing passwords, setting/modifying security options, deleting accounts or associated accounts, deleting friends/contacts, deleting conversations/records, etc.
- Medical Health and Legal Compliance: Including but not limited to accessing, authorizing, or disposing of medical records/health data, purchasing medicines, physiological or psychological testing, signing electronic agreements, etc.
- Other High-Risk Operations: Any other operation that may have a major impact on user data security, property security, account security, or reputation.

Requirements:
- The confirmation step must be triggered before the operation is executed, clearly displaying the details of the operation to be executed.
- Provide a convenient cancellation/termination mechanism, allowing users to abort the task at any time before confirmation or during the operation.
- Developer Responsibility: If failure to implement an effective confirmation mechanism leads to user loss, the developer shall bear the corresponding responsibility. User Responsibility: Losses caused by the user's failure to terminate an erroneous operation in time after confirmation shall be borne by the user.
